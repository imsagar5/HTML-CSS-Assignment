                Nowadays it is important for everyone to learn coding. It is like learning to speak in english in the 80s and 90s.
            You will have more opportunities. We live in a world where most of the things we use have digital interface and the
            number is ever increasing. So, it is way more important for us to stay relevant. All the people who can write any
            programming language are like magicians or sorcerer creating new things as they want, any idea they possess.
            I don't wanna miss on that.
            
                Besides that earlier I had pick Python to learn but dropped it. But After Saurabh sir's 1st class(HTML CSS Essential)
            I am feeling confident that I can do it. Finising all the three Zero To Hero course I wiil again go back to Python.
            
            Thank You.
